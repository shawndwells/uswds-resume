- sessionName: "An Open Source Approach to FedRAMP"
  sessionDate: 2019-07-23
  eventName: Carahsoft FedRAMP Forum
  sessionAbstract: |
    <p>Recent news headlines include how GSA took their ATO process from 6 months to 30 days, the Navy's
    "Compile to Combat in 24 hours" capability, or how ORock achieved FedRAMP Moderate in three months.
    These rapid ATO success stories sharply contrast to opinions that FedRAMP, FISMA, and broader initiatives
    like Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) slow down innovation.</p>
    <p>Via NIST 800-53 the U.S. Government created a security control catalog. Could a <i>response</i> catalog
    be created, sharing prepopulated answers for common technologies like operating systems and container
    platforms? If we could create a control <i>response</i> catalog, could deployment specific ATO materials
    be dynamically generated?</p>
    <p>This talk steps through a joint industry/government initiative called OpenControl, which in partnership
    with GSA and NIST, is working to automate much of the ATO process.</p>
