  description: |
    <p>Two years ago, the U.S. government took an important step towards its technological future.
    The issuance of the Federal Source Code Policy in 2016 called for "efficiency, transparency, and
    innovation through reusable and open source software." Since then, a number of important programs
    and initiatives have been created, including Code.gov, code.mil and others.</p>
    <p>Yet we believe there is still a significant amount of untapped potential for open source
    in government. That’s why we have created the Red Hat OPEN FIRST Road Tour, a nationwide
    seminar series aimed at bringing the open source discussion to government leaders across the U.S.</p>
